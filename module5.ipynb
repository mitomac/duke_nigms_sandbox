    "Welcome to this tutorial on statistical analysis using R. In this notebook, we'll work through an experiment designed to test whether the neurotransmitter **norepinephrine** controls the formation of cardiac muscle cells in rats. This analysis will guide you through data loading, visualization, outlier detection, and various statistical tests, including t-tests and ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and inspect a dataset in R.\n",
    "2. Visualize data using box plots and line graphs.\n",
    "3. Detect and handle outliers appropriately.\n",
    "4. Perform t-tests and interpret p-values.\n",
    "5. Conduct ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests.\n",

    "## 1. Experiment Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cardiac muscle cells are formed during development and then permanently exit the mitotic cycle.\n",
    "- The experiment aims to test whether **norepinephrine** controls the formation of these cells.\n",
    "- Rats were studied from birth to 19 days of postnatal (PN) age, covering the progression from mitotic to postmitotic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experimental Design:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- On PN1 (Postnatal Day 1), pups received an injection of either **saline** (control) or **6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA)**, a neurotoxin that destroys norepinephrine neurons.\n",
    "- At various ages, mitotic activity in the heart was measured by injecting animals with radiolabeled thymidine.\n",
    "- After 30 minutes, tissues were analyzed for the amount of radiolabel incorporated into DNA relative to total uptake, providing an index of mitotic activity.\n",
    "- **Negative Controls:**\n",
    "  - **Liver DNA Synthesis:** Measured in the same animals to check if the effect is specific to the heart.\n",
    "  - **Protein Synthesis:** Measured in additional pups to see if the effect is specific to DNA synthesis.\n",
    "- **Measurements:**\n",
    "  - **Body Weight**\n",
    "  - **Heart DNA Synthesis (heart incorp/uptake)**\n",
    "  - **Liver DNA Synthesis (liver incorp/uptake)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does 6OHDA affect the mitotic activity of developing cardiac muscle cells?\n",
    "2. Is the effect specific to the heart (i.e., not shared by the liver)?\n",
    "3. Is the effect specific to DNA synthesis (i.e., not shared by protein synthesis)?\n",
    "4. Is the effect on cardiac DNA synthesis an artifact of reduced body weight caused by 6OHDA?\n",

    "\n",
    "First, let's take a look at what we need to accomplish:\n",
    "1. Create consistent column names\n",
    "2. Set appropriate data types\n",
    "3. Organize our columns logically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Creating Consistent Column Names\n",
    "First, let's change the column names to something more consistent and easy to work with. R works best with simple, descriptive names that:\n",
    "- Use lowercase letters\n",
    "- Replace spaces with underscores (snake_case)\n",
    "- Avoid special characters\n",
    "- Clearly describe the content\n",
    "\n",

    "clean_data.df <- data.df %>%\n",
    " rename(\n",

    "   body_weight_g = \"bdy wt (g)\",\n",

    "   liver_ratio = \"liver incorp/uptake\",\n",
    "   sample_number = \"#\"\n",
    " )\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Converting Data Types\n",
    "Next, we need to tell R how to interpret our data columns. This is crucial because:\n",
    "- Factors tell R that a variable is categorical (like treatment groups)\n",
    "- Numeric values are needed for calculations\n",
    "- Ordered factors maintain correct sequence (like age groups)\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "clean_data.df <- clean_data.df %>%\n",
    " mutate(\n",
    "   age_days = parse_number(age),          # Extract numbers from age\n",
    "   age_factor = fct_reorder(age, parse_number(age)),  # Order age groups correctly\n",
    "   treatment = factor(treatment),         # Treatment groups are categories\n",
    "   synthesis = factor(synthesis),         # Type of measurement is categorical\n",
    "   cohort = factor(cohort)               # Experimental batches are categories\n",
    " )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Organizing Columns\n",
    "Finally, let's arrange our columns in a logical order to make our data frame easier to work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "clean_data.df <- clean_data.df %>%\n",
    " select(\n",
    "   animal_id, treatment, cohort,          # Identifying information\n",
    "   age_days, age_factor, synthesis,       # Experimental variables\n",
    "   sample_number, body_weight_g,          # Additional measurements\n",
    "   heart_ratio, liver_ratio              # Our main outcome variables\n",
    " )\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Verify Our Work\n",
    "Always good practice to check the cleaned dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "`clean_data.df`\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Proper data cleaning and type setting is crucial for subsequent statistical analysis. Incorrect data types can lead to errors or misleading results in your analysis."

    "## Understanding Statistical Outliers in Biological Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Box Plot Method and Biological Context\n",
    "While statistical methods can identify potential outliers, biological data requires careful consideration beyond pure mathematics. The common box plot method provides a starting point, but should never be used as the sole criterion for data exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Detection Basics\n",
    "The box plot method uses these key components:\n",
    "- Q1: The 25th percentile\n",
    "- Q3: The 75th percentile\n",
    "- IQR: The Interquartile Range (Q3 - Q1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential outlier boundaries are calculated as:\n",
    "- Lower Boundary = Q1 - (1.5 × IQR)\n",
    "- Upper Boundary = Q3 + (1.5 × IQR)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Critical Considerations for Biological Data\n",
    "When evaluating potential outliers in biological data, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Biological Plausibility**\n",
    "  - Is the value physically or biologically possible?\n",
    "  - Example: Synthesis ratios cannot exceed 1.0\n",
    "  - Values outside known biological limits warrant investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Systematic Patterns**\n",
    "  - Look for consistent patterns across multiple measurements\n",
    "  - Example: An animal showing consistently small measurements across all parameters may be a runt, not an outlier\n",
    "  - Single unusual measurements from otherwise normal samples need special scrutiny\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Technical vs. Biological Variation**\n",
    "  - Technical outliers: Values that are impossible or result from clear measurement errors\n",
    "  - Biological outliers: Unusual but potentially valid biological variation\n",
    "  - Technical outliers can be removed with more confidence than biological outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices for Outlier Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Everything**\n",
    "  - Record all criteria used for outlier identification\n",
    "  - Note specific justification for each excluded datapoint\n",
    "  - Maintain transparency in publications about outlier handling\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conservative Approach**\n",
    "  - Only remove data points when you have strong biological or technical justification\n",
    "  - Consider reporting results both with and without outliers\n",
    "  - Be especially cautious with small sample sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Methods**\n",
    "  - Use statistical methods (like `identify_outliers` in rstatix) as screening tools only\n",
    "  - Combine statistical analysis with biological expertise\n",
    "  - Consider consulting subject matter experts for unusual cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warning Signs That Merit Investigation\n",
    "- Values outside physically possible ranges\n",
    "- Measurements that deviate drastically from established literature\n",
    "- Technical readings beyond instrument capabilities\n",
    "- Systematic differences across all measurements from a single subject\n",
    "- Unexplainable extreme values that don't fit known biological mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: It's better to include a potential outlier than to incorrectly exclude valid biological variation. Statistical outlier detection should guide investigation, not automatically determine exclusion."

    "When working with multiple physiological measurements per animal (heart_ratio, liver_ratio, body_weight_g), converting data to long format enables more precise outlier handling. The key advantage is the ability to selectively mark individual measurements as outliers while preserving other valid measurements from the same animal.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Individual animals with multiple outlier measurements, which could indicate:\n",
    "   - Biological phenomena (e.g., developmentally delayed \"runts\")\n",
    "   - Systematic measurement errors affecting multiple organs\n",
    "   - Sample handling issues during processing\n",

    "2. Technical outliers that likely represent measurement errors:\n",

    "   - Inconsistencies between adjacent measurements\n",
    "   - Values far outside the expected physiological range\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Approach\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Calculating interquartile ranges (IQR) within each experimental group\n",
    "2. Showing the extreme outliers relative to these ranges\n",
    "3. Counting multiple outliers per animal\n",
    "4. Preserving contextual information (treatment, age, cohort) for interpretation\n",

    "- Make informed decisions about outlier handling based on biological plausibility\n",

    "## t-test Variants\n",

    "\n",
    "- Welch's t-test has become the standard default in modern statistical software\n",
    "- The term \"t-test\" usually refers to either variant without distinction\n",
    "- Both tests typically produce very similar results in most biological datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Testing Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing multiple t-tests on the same dataset (e.g., comparing treatment effects across different ages or tissues), we need to account for the increased probability of false positives. This is often called the multiple testing problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each t-test has a 5% chance of a false positive (at α = 0.05)\n",
    "- With 20 tests, we expect 1 false positive by chance alone\n",
    "- The more tests we perform, the more likely we are to find \"significant\" results by chance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonferroni Correction\n",
    "The Bonferroni correction is a straightforward method to control for multiple testing:\n",
    "- Multiply each p-value by the number of tests performed\n",
    "- Or divide your significance threshold (α) by the number of tests\n",
    "- Example: With 10 tests, use α = 0.05/10 = 0.005 as the threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "This correction is conservative but simple and widely accepted. While other methods exist (like Benjamini-Hochberg), Bonferroni is often preferred when:\n",
    "- You have a relatively small number of planned comparisons\n",
    "- Strong control of false positives is important\n",
    "- You need a method that's easy to explain and interpret\n",

    "\n",
    "## Research Question and Hypothesis\n",
    "Can the effect of treatment (6OHDA) on cardiac DNA synthesis  be explained simply by changes in body weight. If the treatment's effect is solely due to reduced body weight, we would expect the relationship between body weight and DNA synthesis to be the same for both control and treated animals - just with treated animals being smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Approach\n",
    "To test this, we use Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) which allows us to:\n",
    "1. Control for body weight as a continuous variable (covariate)\n",
    "2. Test if treatments differ after accounting for body weight\n",
    "3. Most importantly, test if the relationship between body weight and DNA synthesis differs between treatments\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANCOVA model tests three key hypotheses:\n",
    "- Is there a relationship between body weight and DNA synthesis? (covariate effect)\n",
    "- Do treatments differ in DNA synthesis when controlling for body weight? (treatment effect)\n",
    "- Does the relationship between body weight and DNA synthesis differ between treatments? (interaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ANCOVA Setup and Variable Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Formula\n",
    "`ratio ~ body_weight_g + treatment + treatment:body_weight_g`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable (Y)**: ratio (DNA synthesis ratio, continuous)\n",
    "- **Covariate (X)**: body_weight_g (continuous)\n",
    "- **Treatment Factor**: treatment (categorical: control vs 6OHDA)\n",
    "- **Interaction**: treatment:body_weight_g (tests if slopes differ between treatments)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Specifications\n",
    "- **Type III Sums of Squares**: Used because:\n",
    " - Handles unbalanced designs\n",
    " - Tests each effect after controlling for all others\n",
    " - Appropriate when interactions are present\n",
    " - Less sensitive to unequal sample sizes\n",

    "Our ANCOVA analysis reveals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Body Weight Effect** (F(1,114) = 13.914, p = 0.0003)\n",
    "  - Significant relationship between body weight and DNA synthesis\n",
    "  - Explains 10.9% of variance (ges = 0.109)\n",
    "  - Confirms body weight is indeed related to DNA synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Treatment Effect** (F(1,114) = 19.099, p = 0.00003)\n",
    "  - Significant difference between treatments after controlling for body weight\n",
    "  - Largest effect, explaining 14.3% of variance (ges = 0.143)\n",
    "  - Shows treatment affects DNA synthesis beyond just weight changes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Body Weight × Treatment Interaction** (F(1,114) = 11.999, p = 0.0008)\n",
    "  - Significant interaction indicates different slopes between treatments\n",
    "  - Explains 9.5% of variance (ges = 0.095)\n",
    "  - **Critical finding**: The relationship between body weight and DNA synthesis differs between treatments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The significant interaction proves that body weight reduction alone cannot explain the treatment effect on cardiac DNA synthesis. If the treatment effect was simply due to reduced body weight, we would expect parallel regression lines (no interaction). Instead, we find that treatment fundamentally alters how DNA synthesis relates to body weight, indicating a more complex biological effect beyond simple growth reduction."
